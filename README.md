# Backups

App with the objetive of letting you storage all type of data and files. You'll need to be authenticated first

## Some of the features that this app will have:

* Storage for every authenticated user (with mb/gb limit)
* Configs to make your uploads public/private, so other users are able to see them
* Level system that will grant benefits such like more space to store
* Global live chat and private chat between users
* User profiles

many features aren't avialable yet since i'm working on them

## main tools used:
* js/ts
* node
* react
* redux-toolkit
* next
* sql
* mongodb
* tailwind
* headlessui

# How to run locally
in case you want to see it on your local (idk why you would, since it's not finished), you have to install the dependencies first.

* once you have the repo on your local, use npm install in the backend and frontend folder to install all dependencies
* you have to use a server for the backend and its database (i use xampp)
* use npm start to run the backend (node) and npm run dev to run the frontend (vite)
* in case that the database is not configurated you can create your database locally with xampp and apply its configuration in the database.js file
